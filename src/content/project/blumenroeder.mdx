<ProjectText title="1st try">A little bit later, I created a navigation menu for fun. Then, came motivation and I dived into the project. The task was interesting, I implemented a simple administration page with a [WYSIWYG](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-5/demo/feature-rich/) editor for each page. It is worth noting that I barely used any library and I coded almost everything from scratch.</ProjectText>

<ProjectText title="Final result">After a while, I was unsatisfied with the website. It was not optimal for SEO and I had kept the old navigation hierarchy with 28 pages. Thus, I built everything again from scratch. This time, I used libraries like [Strapi](https://strapi.io/), [Locomotive Scroll](https://locomotivemtl.github.io/locomotive-scroll/) and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). The website is now much faster, easier to maintain, translated in 3 different languages and the user experience is much smoother.</ProjectText>
