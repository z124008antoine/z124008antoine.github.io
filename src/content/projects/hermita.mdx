<ProjectText title="Summary">Hermita is a school project I worked on with three other students. We developed a game in C# using Unity. Hermita was quite an ambitious project but it was very pleasant to work on and I was able to learn a lot from it. We were asked to create a multiplayer game with a rather open theme. We used this opportunity to build a game that would actually be fun to play. </ProjectText>
